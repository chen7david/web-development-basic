# Lesson 1: Introduction To HTML

<p>
In this lesson, we will learn about the first of the three languages called HTML. It helps to metaphorically think of HTML as the structure of a webpage. it is only concerned with describing what things are present on the webpage. What these things look like and how they behave is described by the two other languages that we will learn later. 
</p>

### Lesson Terminology:
- elements ```html <p >hello world</p>```
- tags
    - opening ```html <p>```
    - closing ```html </p>```
    - self-closing ```html <p/>```
- attributes: ```html <p class="some-class-name">```
    - name ```html class=""```
    - value ```html some-class-name```

### Lesson Objectives:
- understand the following concepts
- CSS
- JS

<p>
In this course, we will use these three languages to build our projects. The first language we will look at is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), then CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and finally Java Script A.K.A. (ECMA-Script)
</p>

### Sample Code
- HTML
```html
<p>Hello World, I am HTML</p>

.btn {
    padding: 15px 10px 15px 10px;
    background-color: yellow;
