### Web Development Basic

# Lesson 0: Preface
<p>
In this course, we will learn the basics of web development. With these lessons, we hope to leave you with an intuitive understanding of the building block and the development architecture. We will learn by theory and example, giving you both an understanding and a hands-on experience of the fundamentals.

### Course outline:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

<p>
In this course, we will use these three languages to build our projects. The first language we will look at is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), then CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and finally Java Script A.K.A. (ECMA-Script)
</p>

### Sample Code
Here is some sample code to help you get an idea of what the languages look like. 
- HTML
```html
<p>Hello World, I am HTML</p>
```
- CSS
```css
.btn {
    padding: 15px 10px 15px 10px;
    background-color: yellow;
    color: #FFF;
}
```
- JS
```js
alert('Hellow World, I am JS')
```

Now lets start with lesson one where we will learn about HTML
