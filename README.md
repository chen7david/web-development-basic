# Lesson 1: Introduction To HTML

<p>
In this lesson, we will learn about the first of the three languages called HTML. It helps to metaphorically think of HTML as the structure of a webpage. it is only concerned with describing what things are present on the webpage. What these things look like and how they behave is described by the two other languages that we will learn later. 
</p>

### Lesson Terminology:
- elements 
- tags
    - opening
    - closing
    - self-closing
- attributes:
    - name
    - value
- comments

#### Elements
<p>
An HTML page is just a collection of elements arranged in special ways. An element is made up of smaller parts. These smaller parts are: tags, attributes and content.
Below are some rules for elements:
- elements may or may not have a closing tag, but they always have a beginning tag.
- elements may or may not have attributes.
- elements may or may not have content. 
</p>


```html 
<!-- This is a commnent and will not be rendered on the webpage -->

<!-- Element -->
<p class="some-class-name">hello world</p>

<!-- opening-tag -->
<p>

<!-- closing-tag -->
<p/>

<!-- attribute -->
<p class="some-class-name">

<!-- attribute-name -->
class=""

<!-- attribute-value -->
some-class-name

```

### Lesson Objectives:
- understand the following concepts
- CSS
- JS

<p>
In this course, we will use these three languages to build our projects. The first language we will look at is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), then CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and finally Java Script A.K.A. (ECMA-Script)
</p>

### Sample Code
- HTML
```html
<p>Hello World, I am HTML</p>
```
- CSS
```css
.btn {
    padding: 15px 10px 15px 10px;
    background-color: yellow;
    color: #FFF;
}
```
- JS
```js
alert('Hellow World, I am JS')
```
